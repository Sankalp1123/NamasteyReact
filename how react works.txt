to create an h1 tag in javascript is can be done by initializing document.craeteElement (h1) to a variable using 'const' datatype

to write into console we have to write :heading.innerHTML="Hello world";

to access that we need to get element by using const root = document.getElementBYId("root") [Root is the id given to the div of HTML]

to get this ,we need to write root.appendChild(heading);


<div id="root"></div>
    <script>
        const heading = document.createElement("h1");
        heading.innerHTML="Hello World from Javascript";
        const root = document.getElementById("root");
        root.appendChild(heading);
    </script>
